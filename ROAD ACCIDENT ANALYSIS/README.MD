2. **Primary KPI's** â€“ Total casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident severity, and maximum casualties by type of vehicle
3. **Secondary KPI's** â€“ Total casualties with respect to vehicle type
4. **Monthly trend** â€“ Comparison of casualties for Current Year (CY) vs Previous Year (PY)
5. **Maximum casualties** â€“ By road type
6. **Distribution** â€“ Total casualties by road surface
7. **Relation analysis** â€“ Casualties by area/location & by day/night
